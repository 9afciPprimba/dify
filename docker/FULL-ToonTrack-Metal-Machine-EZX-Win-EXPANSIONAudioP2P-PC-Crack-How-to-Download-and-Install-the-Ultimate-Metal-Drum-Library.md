Now that you have installed the Metal Machine EZX, you might be wondering how to use it to create some killer metal drum tracks. Here are some tips and techniques that will help you get the most out of this library:

- Use double bass drumming to create fast and powerful rhythms. Double bass drum pedals, or the use of two bass drums, is one of the most defining characteristics of almost all of the metal sub-genres. You can use them to play steady 16th notes, syncopated patterns, or even blast beats for extreme metal styles. The Metal Machine EZX has two kick drums that you can mix and match to get different tones and textures.[^1^]
- Use rim shots to make your snare sound more aggressive and cutting. Rim shots are when you hit the snare drum with the stick tip and the rim at the same time, producing a louder and sharper sound. They are very common in metal drumming, especially for accents and backbeats. The Metal Machine EZX has several snare drums that sound great with rim shots, such as the Tama John Tempesta Signature Series or the Ludwig Black Beauty.[^2^]
- Use drum triggers to enhance your sound and consistency. Drum triggers are devices that attach to your acoustic drums and send a signal to a drum module or a sampler when you hit them. They can be used to trigger additional sounds, such as samples from the Metal Machine EZX, or to replace your acoustic sounds entirely. This can help you achieve a more processed and controlled sound, as well as avoid any unwanted bleed or noise from your mics.[^2^]
- Use cymbal choking to create dynamic effects and transitions. Cymbal choking is when you grab a cymbal with your hand after hitting it, stopping its vibration and creating a short and abrupt sound. This can be used to create contrast and tension in your drum parts, as well as to end a section or a song with a dramatic effect. The Metal Machine EZX has several cymbals that respond well to choking, such as the Zildjian Oriental Trash or the Z3 Trash Ride.[^1^]
- Use reverb to add depth and space to your drum sound. Reverb is an effect that simulates the sound of a room or a hall, adding ambience and dimension to your drums. It can help you create different moods and atmospheres for your metal tracks, from dark and claustrophobic to bright and epic. The Metal Machine EZX has a built-in mixer that allows you to adjust the reverb level and type for each drum channel. A drum-production trick well worth experimenting with, when appropriate, is brightening up your reverb return. Try removing the low-frequency content of the reverb return below 200Hz, boosting its presence at around 3-4kHz and possibly adding 'air' at around 10-12kHz.[^3^]

With these tips and techniques, you should be able to create some amazing metal drum tracks using the Metal Machine EZX. Remember that mixing is a creative process, so don't be afraid to experiment and find your own sound. Have fun!
