In this article, we will show you how to use HD Online Player (minipro tl866cs software free download) to program EEPROMs with the TL866CS or TL866A Mini eeprom programmer. You will need the following items:
 
- A TL866CS or TL866A Mini eeprom programmer. The TL866CS and TL866A are high-performance universal programmers that support over 17000+ devices. They have a built-in MCU with high-speed USB interface and low power consumption. The TL866A has an additional ICSP port that can program some microcontrollers in-circuit. The TL866CS and TL866A have ceased production and may be counterfeit products if sold in large numbers[^1^].
- A USB cable to connect the programmer to your computer.
- An EEPROM chip that you want to program. Make sure it is compatible with the programmer and the software. You can check the supported device list on the official website[^2^].
- A socket adapter that matches the pinout of your EEPROM chip. The programmer has a 40-pin ZIF socket that can accommodate most DIP chips. If your chip is in a different package, such as SOP, PLCC, TSOP, etc., you will need a suitable adapter to connect it to the programmer.
- HD Online Player (minipro tl866cs software free download) software. This is a third-party software that can operate the TL866CS and TL866A programmers. It has a simple and user-friendly interface that allows you to read, write, verify, erase, and protect EEPROMs. You can download it for free from this link[^3^].

Once you have all the items ready, follow these steps to program your EEPROM:

1. Install HD Online Player (minipro tl866cs software free download) software on your computer. Run it as administrator if needed.
2. Connect the programmer to your computer via USB cable. The software should detect it automatically and show its model and firmware version on the status bar.
3. Insert your EEPROM chip into the socket adapter and plug it into the programmer. Make sure it is aligned correctly and firmly seated.
4. Select your chip type from the device list on the left panel of the software. You can use the search function or browse by categories to find it.
5. Click on the Read button on the toolbar to read the data from your chip. The data will be displayed in hexadecimal format on the right panel of the software. You can also view it in ASCII or binary format by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
6. If you want to modify the data, you can edit it directly on the right panel or use the tools on the toolbar, such as fill, copy, paste, compare, etc.
7. If you want to write new data to your chip, you can either load a file from your computer by clicking on the Open button on the toolbar or create a new file by clicking on the New button. You can also save your current data to a file by clicking on the Save button.
8. Click on the Write button on the toolbar to write your data to your chip. The software will prompt you to confirm and then start writing. You can monitor the progress and status on the bottom panel of the software.
9. Click on the Verify button on the toolbar to verify that your data has been written correctly to your chip. The software will compare your data with the data on your chip and show you any differences or errors.
10. If you want to erase your chip, click on the Erase button on the toolbar. The software will prompt you to confirm and then start erasing. You can monitor the progress and status on the bottom panel of the software.
11. If you want to protect your chip from being read or written by others, click on the Protect button on the toolbar. The software will prompt you to select 0f148eb4a0
