# Pengantar Etika Bisnis K Bertens Downloadl: A Review of a Book on Business Ethics
 
Business ethics is a topic that has gained more attention and importance in the modern world. It is the reflection or thinking about morality in economics and business. Morality is always related to what humans do and economic activity is an important area of human behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that ethics also highlights economics and business. Business itself and all parties involved in it will be harmed if this ethical aspect is ignored. Therefore, ethics should also be given a place when we educate and train young people who want to choose business as their profession.

Business ethics is not only a theoretical or academic matter, but also a practical and relevant one. It affects the decisions and actions of various stakeholders in the business world, such as managers, employees, consumers, investors, suppliers, competitors, regulators, and society. Business ethics also has implications for the environment, human rights, social justice, and global development.
 
Therefore, business ethics requires critical thinking and moral reasoning skills, as well as awareness and sensitivity to ethical issues and dilemmas.

Business ethics is not a fixed or universal set of rules, but rather a dynamic and contextual process of reflection and dialogue.
