Universal Shield 4.7 is a powerful and versatile tool that can protect your data from various threats. However, you should also follow some best practices to ensure the security of your data. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

- Always backup your data regularly. Universal Shield 4.7 can encrypt and hide your data, but it cannot prevent data loss due to hardware failure, virus infection, accidental deletion or other causes. Therefore, you should always have a copy of your important data in a safe location.
- Use strong passwords for your encrypted files and folders. Universal Shield 4.7 allows you to set passwords for your protected data, but you should choose passwords that are hard to guess or crack. Avoid using common words, names, dates or personal information as passwords. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Change your passwords periodically and do not share them with anyone.
